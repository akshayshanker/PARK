# Open Source Tools for `Heterogeneous Agent' Modeling

# SUMMARY

	`Representative Agent' models in economics assume that differences across people (say, between poor and rich) do not matter for broad economic outcomes. Such models performed poorly in the Great Recession; but progress in `heterogeneous agent' modeling has been held back because the tools for working with such models are primitive. The Econ-ARK/HARK project provides a Python-based set of tools that make it much easier to get started, and to make rapid progress, in handling the computational challenges of taking account of the differences between agents (in preferences, in incomes, in beliefs) that matter for overall economic outcomes.

# ABSTRACT

The Econ-ARK/HARK toolkit is a modular and extensible open source toolkit for solving, simulating, and estimating heterogeneous-agent (HA) models. Although the value of models of this kind has been clear both to academics and to policymakers for a long time, the code for implementing such models has so far been handcrafted and idiosyncratic. As a result, it may take years of human capital development for a new researcher to become proficient enough in these methods to contribute to the literature. Seminar participants will see examples of ways in which the Heterogeneous Agents Resources and toolKit (HARK) eases this burden by providing a robust and easily extensible framework in which canonical examples of such models are solved. The toolkit provides object-oriented frameworks for representing heterogeneous agents, solution methods for solving or characterizing their dynamic choice problems, and for capturing the economic environment in which agents interact. The aim of the toolkit is to become the go-to resource for heterogeneous agent modelers, by providing a well-designed, well-documented, and powerful framework in which they can develop their own work in a robust and replicable manner.
