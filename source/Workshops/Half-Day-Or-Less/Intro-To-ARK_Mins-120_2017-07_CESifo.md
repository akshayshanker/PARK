# Post-CESifo Workshop on the Computational Economics ARK: 'Algorithmic Resources and Toolkit' 

After the conclusion of the official program of this year's official program, you are invited to attend a special workshop that Chris Carroll and Matt White will be running, designed to introduce "The ARK: 'Algorithmic Resources and Toolkit.'"  

The toolkit is motivated by a sense that quantitative structural modeling of agents' behavior (individuals, households, firms), at present, is roughly like econometric modeling in the 1960s:  Lots of theoretical results are available and a great deal can be done in principle, but in practice actually using the tools for research requires an enormous investment of a scholar's time and attention to learn techniques and tools that are fundamentally not economics but algorithmic/computational (in the 1960s, e.g., inverting matrices; now, e.g., solving dynamic stochastic optimization problems).  

The toolkit is built using the suite of open source, transparent tools for collaborative software development that have become ubiquitous in other fields in the last few years:  Github, object-oriented coding, and methods that make it much easier to produce plug-and-play software modules that can be (relatively) easily combined and enhanced and adapted to address new problems.  

Specific aims of the ARK toolkit are:
0.  To make it much, much easier for new scholars to begin serious work with quantitative theory tools;
0.  To make it much, much easier to *teach* these techniques to graduate students so that they can do their dissertation work using them;
0.  To provide a sufficiently compelling infrastructure and environment that even the most advanced modelers will migrate their work (over time) to the platform (as has happened, for representative agent macroeconomics, with the DYNARE toolkit).

The team that has produced the toolkit (and is continuing to develop it) asked for the opportunity to present it to our CESifo group because our attendees are exactly the kinds of researchers who are the target audience for the toolkit.  The presentation will be by Chris Carroll, who, in his tenure as Chief Economist at the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, caused the toolkit to be created; and Matt White, who the CFPB hired to build the toolkit.

Paolo Pelizzari of the University of Venice Ca' Foscari has kindly arranged space for the workshop on the Ca'Foscari campus, which will require a bit of time to reach after the end of lunch at 14:00.

The agenda follows.

* `15:00-16:00` Overview: The ARK as the "Stata" or "Dynare" for Structural Modeling
* `16:00-16:05` Break
* `16:05-17:00` Models and Tools Currently (or soon to be) In the ARK
* `17:00-17:05` Break (and opportunity to unobtrusively flee)
* `17:05-17:30` [Optional] Q&A and Input from Participants About Future Directions

Directions: Participants will need to go to S. Zaccaria and get from there a water bus (vaporetto) to S. Basilio; then walk 1 minute, see the map [here](http://static.unive.it/mappe/sede/990007).
