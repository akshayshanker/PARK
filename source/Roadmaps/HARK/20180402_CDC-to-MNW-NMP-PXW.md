# HARK 2.0 Thoughts

How should we design "Econ-ARK/HARK 2.0" from the ground up to be consonant with the design of a general purpose modeling language ("dolo"?)

The idea is not that there is any prospect of the Econ-ARK tools being usable in the near term as an engine for solving models described by `dolo` the way DYNARE can solve models described in mod files.  But we hope this will become true gradually over time, starting with a few baby examples and eventually expanding to more and more of the models describable using dolo.

For that to work, there will need to be some deep kinds of compatibility between the internals of Econ-ARK/HARK and the "grammar" of dolo.  Furthermore, that "grammar" is likely to be a powerful tool for thinking about how best to organize and structure the code. 

To sketch the kind of thing I have in mind, recall that Econ-ARK/HARK is (at present, and for the foreseeable future) concerned with solving problems that can be described via a Bellman equation.  

So, at the most abstract level, we need to have as inputs the following kinds of objects (abstract description followed by concrete example drawn from the consumption/saving/portfolio problem described in [SolvingMicroDSOPs](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/SolvingMicroDSOPs/)):

	

0. Current state variables:
    * $M_{t}, P_{t}$ where $M_{t}$ is market resources (money) and $P_{t}$ is permanent income, and lower case Roman variables are normalized by permanent income, e.g. $m_{t}=M_{t}/P_{t}$ or $c_{t}=C_{t}/P_{t}$
0. A current-period payoff function
    * $u(c)$
0. Control variables
    * $\{c,\omega\}$ where $\omega$ is for example the share of a portfolio in risky assets;
0. Transition equations (and constraints) between decision time and the future value; 
    * $m_{t+1}=(m_{t}-c_{t})(\omega \tilde{R} + (1-\omega) R)+y_{t+1}$
    * $c_{t} \leq m_{t}$
0. The $t+1$ value function, marginal value function, marginal marginal value function, and decision rules:
    * $\{v_{t+1}(m),v^{\prime}_{t+1}(m),v^{\prime\prime}_{t+1}(m),c_{t+1}(m_{t+1}),\omega_{t+1}(m_{t+1})\}$
0. Descriptions of the nature of the stochastic processes that intervene between $t$ and $t+1$
    * $\log \tilde{R} \sim \mathcal{N}(\tilde{r},\sigma^{2}_{\tilde{R}})$
    * $\log P_{t+1}= \log P_{t} + \log \Psi_{t+1}$ where $\Psi_{t+1}$ is the lognormally distributed permanent shock to income
    * $\log Y_{t+1}= \log P_{t+1} + \log \Theta_{t+1}$ where $\Theta_{t+1}$ is the lognormally distributed transitory shock
0. A method/tool/function/algorithm by which the current value and decision rules are constructed, given all of these objects.
    * Calling $\Xi_{t}$ all of the info described above, we need to know the mapping from $\Xi_{t}$ to:
    * $\{v_{t}(m),v^{\prime}_{t}(m),v^{\prime\prime}_{t}(m),c_{t}(m),\omega_{t}(m)\}$

So, is (part of) the purpose of `dolo` to create a syntax for capturing all of these objects?
