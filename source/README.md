PARK-make is the place to put tools and resources that create the content in the public-facing "PARK" repo (originally we were thinking this is 'presentations about the ARK' but maybe that will be reinterpreted as 'public descriptions of the ARK' or something like that)
* PARK-make would have the same folder structure as the PARK repo, where each folder sould have the tools that generate the corresponding content in the PARK
* The assumption is that on a local machine, PARK and PARK-make are subdirectories of a parent directory, so PARK-make knows how to find and change stuff in PARK
* The idea is to put here material that will be
  * evolving over time
  * something that will need input from multiple people
  * containable in a directory structure
  * a source for creation of public-facing stuff
