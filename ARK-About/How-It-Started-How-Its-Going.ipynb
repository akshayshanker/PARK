    "\n",
    "- Officially founded in 2017, formally organizing work by MNW, NMP, and DCL at CFPB in 2015-16\n",
    "- Received generous grant from [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org) to develop/professionalize HARK package\n",
    "    - [Heterogeneous Agents Resources and toolKit](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK)\n",
    "    - Software package for solving, simulating, estimating heterogeneous agents models\n",
    "    - *Framework* for working with models; all solution and simulation code is handcrafted\n",
    "- Use [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org/) as fiscal sponsor: manager for various open source scientific computing projects\n",
    "- Later received funding from [Think Forward Initiative](https://inomics.com/institution/think-forward-initiative-1258337) and [T. Rowe Price](https://www.troweprice.com/en)\n",
    "- Largely achieved our original set of goals for HARK, but still improving!"

    "    - Simulation procedure details\n",
    "    - Specify model outputs\n",
    "- Input as *model files*, just like [Dynare](https://www.dynare.org/)\n",
    "    - We want to make \"Dynare for heterogeneous agents\"\n",
    "    - (This is what many people thought HARK was \"supposed to be\" on first impression!)\n",
    "- Precisely convey information in machine- and human-readable format\n",
    "- Model file is independent of solution code, but:\n",
    "    - Will develop software platform to parse models into implied code\n",
    "    - Want it to connect to existing solvers/tools for specific problem types\n",
    "- This is big and ambitious, but experience with HARK has set us up well"
