# Workshop on the Computational Economics ARK: 'Algorithmic Resources and Toolkit' 

The toolkit is motivated by a sense that quantitative structural modeling of agents' behavior (individuals, households, firms), at present, is roughly like econometric modeling in the 1960s:  Lots of theoretical results are available and a great deal can be done in principle, but in practice actually using the tools for research requires an enormous investment of a scholar's time and attention to learn techniques and tools that are fundamentally not economics but algorithmic/computational (in the 1960s, e.g., inverting matrices; now, e.g., solving dynamic stochastic optimization problems).  


The Econ-ARK is built using the suite of open source, transparent tools for collaborative software development that have become ubiquitous in other fields in the last few years:  Github, object-oriented coding, and methods that make it much easier to produce plug-and-play software modules that can be (relatively) easily combined and enhanced and adapted to address new problems.  


Specific aims of the ARK toolkit are:
0.  To make it much, much easier for new scholars to begin serious work with quantitative theory tools;
0.  To make it much, much easier to *teach* these techniques to graduate students so that they can do their dissertation work using them;
0.  To provide a sufficiently compelling infrastructure and environment that even the most advanced modelers will migrate their work (over time) to the platform (as has happened, for representative agent macroeconomics, with the DYNARE toolkit).

This outline is a generic version of a presentation [most recently made at the Reserve Bank of Australia]

The agenda of the workshop will be:

* `09:15-10:30` The ARK as the "Stata" or "Dynare" for Structural Modeling
* `10:30-10:45` Break
* `10:45-11:30` Models and Tools Currently (or soon to be) In the ARK
* `11:30-11:45` Break
* `11:45-12:30` [Optional] Q&A and Input from Participants About Future Directions
